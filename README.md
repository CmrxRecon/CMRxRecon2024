## Motivation
The objective of establishing the CMRxUniversalRecon challenge (Toward Universal Reconstruction) is to provide a benchmark that enables the broader research community to contribute to the important work of accelerated CMR imaging with universal approaches that allow more diverse applications and better performance in real-world deployment in various environments.

## Background
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has emerged as a crucial imaging technique for diagnosing cardiac diseases, thanks to its excellent soft tissue contrast and non-invasive nature. **However, a notable limitation of MRI is its slow imaging speed, which causes patient discomfort and introduces motion artifacts into the images.**

To accelerate image acquisition, CMR image reconstruction (recovering high-quality clinical interpretable images from highly under-sampled k-space data) has gained significant attention in recent years. Particularly, AI-based image reconstruction algorithms have shown great potential in improving imaging performance by utilizing highly under-sampled data. Currently, the field of CMR reconstruction lacks publicly available, standardized, and high-quality datasets for the development and assessment for AI-based CMR reconstruction. In the first run of the 'CMRxRecon' challenge (MICCAI 2023), we have provided cine and mapping data from a total of 300 subjects and the technical infrastructure as well as a baseline model for CMR reconstructions. The results of 'CMRxRecon' 2023 demonstrated that deep learning methods demonstrated significantly superior performance compared to traditional methods such as SENSE and GRAPPA in a single task scenario.

As we all know, CMR imaging has the nature of multi-contrast, e.g., cardiac cine, mapping, tagging, phase-contrast, and dark-blood imaging. It also includes imaging of different anatomical views such as long-axis (2-chamber, 3-chamber, and 4-chamber), short-axis, outflow tract, and aortic (cross-sectional and sagittal views). Additionally, accelerated imaging trajectories, including uniformly undersampling and variable-density sampling, are employed. **Unfortunately, conventional CNN-based reconstruction models often require training and deployment for each specific imaging scenario (imaging sequence, view, and device vendor), limiting their clinical application in the real world.**

Thus, in this second run of the CMR reconstruction challenge we aim to make an important step towards clinical implementation by extending the challenge scope in two directions:
**1) Trustworthy reconstruction on multi-contrast CMR imaging (two will be unseen in the training dataset) using a universal pre-trained reconstruction model;**
**2) Robust reconstruction with diverse k-space trajectory and various acceleration factors using a universal model.**  

This repository contains Matlab code for data loaders, undersampling functions, evaluation metrics, and reference implementations of simple baseline methods. It also contains implementations for methods in some of the publications of the CMRxRecon project.

## Challenge tasks
The 'CMRxRecon2024' challenge includes two independent tasks. Each team can choose to participate one of them or both:

**TASK 1: Multi-contrast CMR reconstruction**

**1) Goal:** To develop a contrast-universal model that can 1) provide high-quality image reconstruction for highly-accelerated uniform undersampling (acceleration factors are 4x, 8x and 10x, ACS not included for calculations); 2) being able to process multiple contrast reconstructions with different sequences, views, and scanning protocols using a single universal model. The proposed method is supposed to offer a unified framework that can handle various imaging contrasts, allowing for faster and more robust reconstructions across different CMR protocols.

**2) Note:** In TASK 1, participants are allowed to train **three individual contrast-universal models** to respectively reconstruct multi-contrast data at the aforementioned three acceleration factors; **TrainingSet includes Cine, Aorta, Mapping, and Tagging; ValidationSet and TestSet include Cine, Aorta, Mapping, Tagging, and other two unseen contrasts (Flow2d and BlackBlood)**; the data size of Cine, Aorta, Mapping, Tagging, and Flow2d is 5D (nx,ny,nc,nz,nt); the data size of BlackBlood is 4D (nx,ny,nc,nz); **the size of all undersampling masks is 2D (nx,ny)**, the central 16 lines (ny) are always fully sampled to be used as autocalibration signals (ACS).

**TASK 2: Random sampling CMR reconstruction**

**1) Goal:** To develop a sampling-universal model that can robustly reconstruct CMR images 1) from different k-space trajectories (uniform, Guassian, and pseudo radial undersampling with temporal/parametric interleaving); 2) at different acceleration factors (acceleration factors from 4x to 24x, ACS not included for calculations). The proposed method is supposed to leverage deep learning algorithms to exploit the potential of random sampling, enabling faster acquisition times while maintaining high-quality image reconstructions.

**2) Note:** In TASK 2, participants are allowed to train **only one universal model** to reconstruct various data at the different undersampling scenarios (including different k-space trajectories: uniform, Guassian, and pseudo radial undersampling with temporal/parametric interleaving; and different acceleration factors: 4x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x, ACS not included for calculations); **TrainingSet includes Cine, Aorta, Mapping, and Tagging; ValidationSet and TestSet also include Cine, Aorta, Mapping, and Tagging**; the data size of Cine, Aorta, Mapping, and Tagging is 5D (nx,ny,nc,nz,nt); **the size of all undersampling masks is 3D (nx,ny,nt)**, the central 16 lines (ny, in ktUniform and ktGaussian) or central 16x16 regions (nx*ny, in ktRadial) are always fully sampled to be used as autocalibration signals (ACS).

### The CMRxRecon2024 Dataset
A total of 330 healthy volunteers are recruited for multi-contrast CMR imaging in our imaging center (3.0T Siemens Vida). **The dataset include multi-contrast k-space data, consist of cardiac cine, T1/T2mapping, tagging, phase-contrast (i.e., flow2d), and dark-blood imaging. It also includes imaging of different anatomical views like long-axis (2-chamber, 3-chamber, and 4-chamber), short-axis (SAX), left ventricul outflow tract (LVOT), and aorta (transversal and sagittal views)**.
