## The matlab script for varied mask generation for TrainingSet in Task 1&2 (CMRxRecon MICCAI2024)

# Package Structure
1. Folder `Task1`: The matlab script for varied mask generation for TrainingSet in Task 1 (2D kspace undersampling mask)
* `MaskGeneration_Task1_TrainingSet`: This is a demo to generate varied 2D masks for TrainingSet in Task 1 (this step is optional if you need more different masks for training!!!)
* `MaskGeneration_Task1_Demo`: This is a demo to generate typical 2D masks in Task 1 for understanding their properties

2. Folder `Task2`: The matlab script for varied mask generation for TrainingSet in Task 2 (3D kspace-temporal undersampling mask)
* `MaskGeneration_Task2_TrainingSet`: This is a demo to generate varied 3D masks for TrainingSet in Task 2 (this step is optional if you need more different masks for training!!!)
* `MaskGeneration_Task2_Demo`: This is a demo to generate typical 3D masks in Task 2 for understanding their properties
